### 1. DBMS Overview

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a software used to manage and organize data in a database. It allows users to create, update, retrieve, and secure data in an efficient manner. Databases can store various types of data, such as text, images, and videos.

- **Relational DBMS**: Stores data in tables (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server).
- **NoSQL DBMS**: Stores data in key-value pairs (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis).

DBMS is essential for managing large datasets and ensuring data integrity and security.
