# Relational-Database

## Introduction
As I embark on my certification journey in developer tools and software, Iâ€™ve explored various technologies that are fundamental to modern software development. This README outlines my findings and experiences as I progress through the courses and projects, focusing on Bash, PostgreSQL, and Git.

## Course Overview
1. Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate
In this 170-lesson course, I learned essential terminal commands by creating a website boilerplate entirely through the command line. This hands-on approach helped me understand how to manipulate the file system and automate tasks effectively.

2. Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database
Through this 165-lesson course, I gained insights into relational databases by designing a PostgreSQL database populated with video game characters. I learned about tables, relationships, and the basics of SQL.

3. Celestial Bodies Database
For this project, I built a database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL. This was a required project for my certification and reinforced my understanding of database design and querying.

4. Learn Bash Scripting by Building Five Programs
In this extensive 220-lesson course, I delved into Bash scripting, combining commands and logic to create five small programs. This experience enhanced my ability to automate tasks efficiently.

5. Learn SQL by Building a Student Database: Part 1
This 140-lesson course introduced me to SQL, where I created a Bash script to enter information about computer science students into PostgreSQL. It was a practical way to learn how to communicate with databases.

6. Learn SQL by Building a Student Database: Part 2
Continuing from the first part, this course deepened my SQL knowledge by guiding me through complex queries and data manipulation. Completing this project solidified my skills in database management.

7. World Cup Database
For this required project, I created a Bash script to input and query data from World Cup games in PostgreSQL. This experience was instrumental in understanding how to work with real-world data and extract useful insights.

8. Learn Advanced Bash by Building a Kitty Ipsum Translator
In this 140-lesson course, I explored more complex Bash commands and scripting techniques. Building a Kitty Ipsum Translator allowed me to experiment with advanced functionalities in Bash.

9. Learn Bash and SQL by Building a Bike Rental Shop
This 210-lesson course was an exciting challenge where I built an interactive Bash program that managed rental information using PostgreSQL. It combined my learning in both Bash and SQL seamlessly.

10. Salon Appointment Scheduler
For this required project, I created an interactive program that tracked customers and appointments for a salon using PostgreSQL. This project helped me understand user interaction with databases.

11. Learn Nano by Building a Castle
In this shorter 40-lesson course, I learned to edit files directly in the terminal using Nano while building a castle. This was a fun way to get comfortable with terminal-based text editing.

12. Learn Git by Building an SQL Reference Object
In this comprehensive 240-lesson course, I learned how to use Git for version control. By creating an SQL reference object, I understood how to track changes and collaborate effectively in software development.

13. Periodic Table Database
This required project involved creating a Bash script to retrieve information about chemical elements from a periodic table database. It enhanced my scripting skills and database querying abilities.

14. Number Guessing Game
As a final required project, I developed a number guessing game using Bash scripting, PostgreSQL, and Git. This fun application allowed me to integrate everything I learned in a practical way.

## Conclusion
Through these courses and projects, I have significantly developed my skills in Bash, SQL, and Git. Each project not only reinforced theoretical knowledge but also provided practical experience that I can apply in real-world scenarios. I look forward to continuing my learning journey and applying these skills in future endeavors.
